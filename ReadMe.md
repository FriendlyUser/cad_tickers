## Cad Tickers
Function to extract exchange data from the cse and tsx websites and various other data sources. This package is primarily focussed on scrapping data for the canadian stock market.


The entire 0.2.x version of tsx functions are now depricated.

Tsx has switched to graphql which I like.


### How to run tests

```
pytest
```

```
# Needed for readthedocs documentation
poetry export -f requirements.txt > requirements.txt.
```
