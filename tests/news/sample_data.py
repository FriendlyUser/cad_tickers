Montreal – TheNewswire
- November 25, 2020 Ecolomondo
Corporation (TSXV:ECM) (the “Company” or “Ecolomondo”)
releases its unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and
notes hereto and its related management discussion & analysis
(“MD&A”) for the interim period ended September 30, 2020 (the
“Interim Financial
Statements”). 


During the period, the Company made considerable
progress on the construction of its new Hawkesbury Thermal
Decomposition (“TDP”) turnkey facility. Management estimates
that construction of the building that will house the plant is about
90% complete and expects completion by the end of 2020. Installation
of the plant equipment began in late August of 2020 and is proceeding
according to schedule while commissioning is now scheduled to begin in
the first quarter of 2021.

To view further updates of the Hawkesbury TDP facility,
please visit the Company’s website at www.ecolomondo.com. 


As of September 30, 2020, capital expenditures for the
Hawkesbury facility totalled $19,965,404 and were essentially for site
purchase, engineering, site preparation, building construction, labor,
permitting, equipment purchases and installation. Management believes
that the project will be completed on budget and expects to begin
commercial operations by the end of April of 2021.


During the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the
Company continued to ready its Pilot plant, located in Contrecoeur,
Quebec, Canada, a 2-reactor industrial-size TDP facility, to operate
as the training center to train future operators needed for the
thermal processing department at its new TDP turnkey facility in
Hawkesbury.


The Company continued to market all of its end-products
and to secure offtake agreements for them, especially its recovered
carbon black, known as “Mondo Black”. The Company was also quite
active in marketing TDP turnkey facilities, in Canada, USA and Europe.



It also continued to improve its technology platform
and make important progress in the areas of process optimization,
efficiency, safety and end-product quality. Once built, the Hawkesbury
facility will be comprised of four different processing departments
(shredding, thermal processing, recovered carbon black processing, oil
fractionation) and, once fully operational, this facility is expected
to process a minimum of 14,000 tons of tire waste per year and produce
5,300 tons of recovered carbon black, 42,700 barrels of oil, 1,800
tons of steel, 1,600 tons of process gas and 850 tons of fiber.



During this period, the Company worked aggressively to
complete the construction of its new Hawkesbury TDP turnkey facility.
Once completed, this facility will be a first of its kind and be used
as a technological showpiece to promote the sale of TDP turnkey
facilities globally. Management believes that once the Hawkesbury facility comes online,
it is expected to be a testimonial of the commercial viability of TDP
turnkey facilities and, as a
result, it is expected to promote the sale of other TDP turnkey
facilities.


Impact of the COVID-19
Pandemic


The world economy is still impacted by the crisis
created by the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic
has resulted in the confinement of the population of Canada and many
countries around the world.


The Company has taken and will continue to take all
necessary actions needed to reduce the impact of the crisis created by
the coronavirus. The Company expects that the milestone to complete
the plant under construction in Hawkesbury, Ontario, will not be
materially impacted by the current situation. The Company has experienced some
delays in lead times for certain parts, and some work slowdown by
subcontractors due to labor shortages. It is to
note, it is impossible to determine with certitude the long-term
consequences and financial implications if the current situation
persists. 


About Ecolomondo Corporation


Ecolomondo is a cleantech Canadian company that is
commercializing its waste-to-products technology. The Thermal
Decomposition Process (“TDP”) converts hydrocarbon waste into
marketable commodity end-products, namely carbon black substitute,
oil, gas and steel. Technologies such as Ecolomondo’s are expected
to play an important role in resource recovery needed in today’s
circular economy. 


The Company’s main revenues will come from the sale
of TDP turnkey facilities and royalties from their operations. TDP
facilities will generate revenues from the sale of end-products,
tipping fees and carbon credits. Ecolomondo’s first focus is to
market TDP turnkey facilities that use scrap tires as a feedstock,
because scrap tires yield end-products with a higher commercial value,
especially the recycled carbon black.


Management believes that technological breakthroughs in
areas of emissions, process optimization, automation, end-product
processing and safety, position Ecolomondo to become an industry
leader in the resource recovery of hydrocarbon waste.
